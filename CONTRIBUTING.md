# Contributing to Steam

Steam is an open source project released under the GNU Affero General Public License. Open Source projects live by their user and developer communities. We welcome and encourage your contributions of any kind!

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Some of the most valuable contributions that you can make are to report bugs and make feature requests. The development work on Steam is largely driven by these, so please make your voice heard! 

All bugs and feature requests get added to the [JIRA tracking system] (https://0xdata.atlassian.net/projects/STEAM/issues/), where you can track their progress. You can also vote for bugs and feature requests that are added to JIRA. To vote for a JIRA issue, log in the the H2O JIRA tracking system (create an account if necessary), find or create the issue that you want to vote for, then click the **Vote for this issue** link (upper right portion of the issue). Voting can help H2O prioritize the features that are included in each release. 

**Note**: Bug reports are most helpful if you send us a script which reproduces the problem.
