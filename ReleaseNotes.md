# Steam Release Notes

Thank you for you interest in Steam, the industryâ€™s first data science hub that lets data scientists and developers collaboratively build, deploy, and refine predictive applications across large scale datasets. 

The most valuable contributions that you can make are to report bugs and make feature requests. The development work on Steam is largely driven by these, so please make your voice heard! 

All bugs and feature requests get added to the <a href="https://0xdata.atlassian.net/projects/STEAM/issues/">JIRA tracking system</a>, where you can track their progress. You can also vote for bugs and feature requests that are added to JIRA. To vote for a JIRA issue, log in the the H2O JIRA tracking system (create an account if necessary), find or create the issue that you want to vote for, then click the **Vote for this issue** link (upper right portion of the issue). Voting can help H2O prioritize the features that are included in each release. 

**Note**: Bug reports are most helpful if you send us a script which reproduces the problem.

If you're an Open Source community member, you can contact H2O using one of the following methods:

- Click the Support link in the Steam UI to send an e-mail message
- Send an e-mail message directly to <a href="mailto:support@h2o.ai">support@h2o.ai</a>
- Ask your question on the <a href="https://community.h2o.ai/spaces/540/index.html">H2O Community</a> site (create an account if necessary)
