# H2O Scoring Service Builder

This is a service that can 

1. Build a Jar file from a Pojo and a gen-model file

2. Build a War file that is a service from a Pojo, gen-model and
another Jar file

You can run the war file in Jetty, Tomcat, etc.

## How to Build 

gradle wrapper

./gradlew build

# War web service

./gradlew jettyRunWar

starts a web server on localhost:8080 

This web server can build a WAR file from an H2O Pojo,
h2o-genmodel.jar file and a an extra jar file. Example files are in
directory example-pojo.

curl -X POST --form pojo=@example-pojo/gbm_3f258f27_f0ad_4520_b6a5_3d2bb4a9b0ff.java --form jar=@example-pojo/h2o-genmodel.jar --form extra=@makewar-extra.jar localhost:8080/makewar > gbm.war

gbm_3f258f27_f0ad_4520_b6a5_3d2bb4a9b0ff.java is the Pojo from
H2O. h2o-genmodel.jar is the corresponding jar file from the version
of H2O. makewar-extra.jar is a jar file that contains additional files
needed to build the war file.

If you go to http://localhost:8080 you get a web page with a form that
can be used to create war files.

# Prediction server

The result of the service above is a war file that can be run with

java -jar jetty-runner-9.3.9.M1.jar --port 8081 gbm.war

This in turn starts a web service at localhost:8081 . 

This service can be used for prediction

curl "localhost:8081/predict?Dest=JFK"

which returns a JSON result

{"labelIndex":1,"label":"Y","classProbabilities":[0.026513747179178093,0.9734862528208219]}

The predictor has two classes. "Y" was predicted with probability 0.97.

There is also a web page for the predictor at http://localhost:8081 .

# Jetty runner versions

If you use an older Java version, you need to use an older
jetty-runner. Jetty 9.3 requires Java 1.8. Jetty 9.0-9.2 requires Java
1.7. Jetty 8 requires Java 1.6. 

Testing has been done on Java 1.8 and 1.7. For Java 1.8 you can use
all jetty runners while on Java 1.7 you can use all except the 9.3
version.

# To Do 

The web pages provided are just examples of what can be done and need
to be improved to look good.

We could also improve the handling of the parameters of the predictor
by getting the right types and variable names from the predictor.
