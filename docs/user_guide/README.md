# Introduction

Steam is an "instant on" platform that streamlines the entire process of building and deploying applications. It is the industry's first data science hub that lets data scientists and developers collaboratively build, deploy, and refine predictive applications across large scale datasets. Data scientists can publish Python and R code as REST APIs and easily integrate with production applications.

This document describes how to start and use Steam and the Steam Scoring Service. Note that this document assumes that an admin has successfully installed and started Steam on a YARN edge node using the instructions provided in the *Steam Installation and Setup* guide. 

>**Note**: Before you begin using Steam, be sure that your minimum version of H2O is 3.10.0.3. Earlier versions are not supported. If necessary, follow the instructions on the <a href="http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/choose">H2O Download page</a> for your platform to upgrade H2O.
