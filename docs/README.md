# Installing, Starting, and H2O Using Steam on a YARN Cluster

This document is provided for external users and describes how to install, start, and use Steam on a YARN cluster. For instructions on using Steam on your local machine, refer to the [README.md](../demo/README.md) document in the demo folder.


## Requirements

- Web browser with an Internet connection
- Steam tar for OS X or Linux
- JDK 1.7 or greater
- PostgreSQL 9.1 or greater
	- available from <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL.org</a>
- H2O AutoML package (for example, **automl-hdp2.2.jar**)

## Installation
Perform the following steps to install Steam.

***Note***: This installation should only be performed on a YARN edge node.

1. Open a terminal window and SSH into your YARN edge node. 

		ssh <user>@<yarn_edge_node>

2. Retrieve the Steam release for your OS.

	**Linux**
	
		s3cmd get s3://steam-release/steamY-master-linux-amd64.tar.gz 
		
	**OS X**

		s3cmd get s3://steam-release/steamY-master-darwin-amd64.tar.gz		

	***Note***: This saves the Steam package (tar file) into your current folder.

3. Untar the Steam package. 

	**Linux**
	
		tar -xvf steamY-master-linux-amd64.tar.gz
	   
	**OS X**
	
		tar -xvf steamY-master-darwin-amd64.tar.gz

## Start the PostgreSQL Database

The command starts PostgreSQL. This should be started from the folder where PostgreSQL was installed.

		postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres

## Create a User

This step create a new user for the Steam database and then create the database. The commands below only need to be performed once. The example below creates a steam **superuser** with a password ``superuser`` before creating the Steam database. Be sure to provide a secure password, and be sure to remember the password that you enter. This will be required each time you log in to Steam. 

		createuser -P steam 
		Enter password for new role: superuser
		Enter it again: superuser
		# Change directories to the Steam /var/master/scripts folder.
		cd steam-master-darwin-amd64/var/master/scripts
		./create-database.sh


## Starting Steam and the Steam Scoring Service

Perform the following steps to start Steam and teh Steam Scoring Service. Note that two terminal windows will remain open: one for the Jetty server and one for Steam.

1. Change directories to your Steam directory, then set up the Jetty server using one of the following methods:

	**Linux**
		
		cd steam-master-linux-amd64
		java -jar var/master/assets/jetty-runner.jar var/master/assets/ROOT.war
		
	**OS X**
	
		cd steam-master-darwin-amd64
		java -jar var/master/assets/jetty-runner.jar var/master/assets/ROOT.war

	**Note**: The Jetty server defaults to port 8080. You can optionally provide a `--port` value for jetty-runner.jar.

2. Open another terminal window and ssh to the machine running YARN.

		ssh <user>@<yarn_edge_node>

3. Change directories to the Steam directory (either **steam-master-linux-amd64** or **steam-master-darwin-amd64**), then start the Steam master node. For example, the following commands will start Steam on 192.168.2.182. Note that the port value must match the port running the Jetty server, which defaults to 8080. 

		./steam serve master --compilation-service-address="192.168.2.182:8080"
		
	**Note**: You can view all available options for starting Steam using `./steam help serve master`

	You will see a message similar to the following when Steam starts successfully.

		2016/04/28 13:34:56 steam v build 2016-04-28T20:15:00+0000

		2016/04/28 13:34:57 Point your web browser to http://192.16.2.182:9000/

## Using Steam

In a Web browser, navigate to the Steam Web server (for example, http://192.16.2.182:9000).

### Adding an Engine
An empty Steam UI will display. Before performing any tasks, you must first add an Asset. In this case, the **automl-hdp2.2.jar** file (or similar) provides the engine necessary for Steam to run AutoML jobs. 

1. Click the **Assets** icon (<img src="images/icon_assets.png" alt="Thumbnail" style="width: 25px;" />) on the left navigation panel, then select **Add Engine**. 

	![Adding an Engine](images/add_engine.png)

2. Browse to the **automl-hdp2.2.jar** file on your local machine, then click **Upload**. 

### Starting a Cluster

Cluster can be configured after the engine asset was successfully added. 

1.  Click the **Clusters** icon (<img src="images/icon_clouds.png" alt="Thumbnail" style="width: 25px;" />) on the left navigation panel, then select **Start a Cluster**. 

2. Enter/specify the following information to set up your cloud:

	a. A name for the cluster.

	b. The version of H2O that will run on the cloud.

	c. The number of nodes on the cloud.
	
	d. The amount of memory available on each node. Be sure to include the unit ("m" or "g").
	
	![Adding a cluster](images/add_cloud.png)
	
3. Click **Start Cluster** when you are finished.

The Cluster Details page opens upon successful completion. This page shows the cluster configuration information and includes a link to the H2O Flow URL. From this page, you can begin building your model. 

  ![Cluster details](images/cloud_details.png)

***Note***: You can view a stream of the cluster creation log in the terminal window that is running Steam. In the UI, Steam will respond with an error if the cloud configuration is incorrect (for example, if you specify more nodes than available on the cluster). 

### Adding a Model

Models can be created using Flow, R, or Python when H2O is initialized using this cluster. Once created, the model will automatically be visible in Steam. 

### Viewing Models	

Click the **Models** icon (<img src="images/icon_models.png" alt="Thumbnail" style="width: 25px;" />) on the left navigation panel to view models that were successfully created. 

### Deploying Models

After a model is built, the next step is to deploy the model in order to make/view predictions.

1. Click the **Models** icon (<img src="images/icon_models.png" alt="Thumbnail" style="width: 25px;" />) on the left navigation panel.

2. Select the model that you want to use, then click the **Deploy this Model** button on the bottom of the page.

3. Specify the port to use for the scoring service. 

	***Note***: Steam will return an error if you specify a port that is already being used.

4. Click **Deploy** when you are done.

### Making Predictions

Successfully deployed models can be viewed on the **Services** page. On this page, click the Endpoint link to launch the H2O Prediction Services UI. From this page, you can make predictions using one of the following methods:

   - Specify input values based on column data from the original dataset
    
     OR
    
   - Enter a query string using the format `field1=value1&field2=value2` (for example, `sepal_width=3&petal_len=5`)

Use the **Clear** button to clear all entries and begin a new prediction.
     
You can view additional statistics about the scoring service by clicking the **More Stats** button.

## Using Steam with H2O Flow

As with other H2O products, Flow can be used alongside Steam when performing machine learning tasks.

On the Cloud Details page, click the **Address** link to open H2O Flow in a new tab.

***Note***: Refer to the H2O Flow documentation for information on how to use Flow. 

## Stopping Steam	

When you are finished, use the following process to safely shut down Steam:

1. On the Services page, stop all running services.

2. Stop all running clouds.
